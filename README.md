Programming Challengues
=======================

This is a collection of UVA problems solved by the author. 

OS: MacOSX <br />
IDE: Xcode <br />
Compiler: GCC <br />

Compilation <br />
Every problem is compiled using GCC from the terminal. <br />
Example: <br />
gcc source.c -o problem_number

Execution: <br />
./problem_number

To automate input entry, I suggest creating a text file containg sample input. <br />
Then, it can be used like: <br />
./problem_number < text_file
