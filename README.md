=======================

This is a collection of UVA problems solved by the author. 

OS: MacOSX
IDE: Xcode
Compiler: GCC

Compilation
Every problem is compiled using GCC from the terminal. Example:
gcc source.c -o problem_number

Execution:
./problem_number

To automate input entry, I suggest creating a text file containg sample input. Then, it can be used like:
./problem_number < text_file
